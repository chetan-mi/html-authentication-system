This project implements a fully structured static authentication system using only HTML. The application simulates a real-world user authentication flow including login, registration, forgot password, reset password, and dashboard navigation.

The system is built strictly using semantic HTML elements and hyperlink-based navigation without JavaScript, CSS frameworks, or backend integration. Page transitions are handled using form actions and anchor tag redirection, maintaining clean structure and logical navigation flow.

Features implemented:

• Login Page
• Registration Page
• Forgot Password Page
• Reset Password Page
• Dashboard Page
• Proper inter-page redirection using href and form action
• Clean semantic HTML structure
• Professional file organization

This project demonstrates foundational understanding of HTML form handling, page structuring, navigation logic, and authentication flow modeling at a static level.
